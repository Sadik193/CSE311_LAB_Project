# CSE311_LAB_Project

###  Objectives:

Here we have to develop/build a surokkha.gov.bd website for COVID-19 vaccine registration. In our project, there are mainly four tables/databases. These are the Student,Hospital,University and login table


###  Procedure:

In the student database, either a student can log in by providing a user name and a valid password or register by providing their NID number, date of birth. They can choose the hospital name where they are interested in taking the vaccine. Whether a student’s registration is complete depends on whether the NID number already exists in the Admin panel database or not, provided by the university database. After completing registration, students can view all the necessary information like name, university name, date of the first dose, hospital name, etc. Students can also download all the data as a pdf. There will send an email to the students email the day before the vaccination too. 

In the university database, they can also log in and register to the website. After login, they can input/add/update the student database file. They can view the whole student database. They can check the student database with the registration database of the Admin panel and can find out whose students are already registered or not for vaccines. The students who are not registered yet view as null. They can also check the student’s list who has completed 2/1 dose or is not vaccinated yet. 

In the Admin database, they can add any student. They can increase the seat of hospitals. They can view when a student is register, vaccinated, etc. They can also update the information. If they want, they can delay the vaccination date of any student too. 

In the hospital database, they can also register or log in. They can view the total seat capacity of the hospital, the total number of vaccines, how many students have already registered, etc. They can provide all other hospital’s information.
